      My leadership experiences have given me the skills to work with people of different personalities, work styles,
      backgrounds, and strengths to create a successful team. Volunteering, in high school, continuing at Rice/Houston,
      and now in Atlanta has continued to expand my perspective as I have listened to people from all walks of life.
      I believe that growing this understanding is critical to learning how to best support underrepresented groups in our
      society and improve education in the United States. These leadership experiences enable me to mentor and support
      other women and underrepresented minorities in STEM.

It is comprised of trainees from across eight Georgia Tech departments and multiple colleges. This coming year, I am excited to lead the BBUGS team in its continued success in building connections and community among talented trainees and researchers in the Petit Institute for Bioengineering and Bioscience. Some of our events this year include the annual whitewater rafting and camping trip, the BBUGS carnival to inform students about our committees and events, weekly gardening maintenance at community gardens on campus, alumni career talks, and outreach events at local elementary and high schools.</p>

      <p id="fernbank-natural-science-museum-volunteer-desc" class="card-text">Sometimes community service is standing out of the way and waiting until you're needed. Giving, and not expecting anything in return. But I've found that volunteering at Fernbank, I am gaining a lot, maybe even more than I am giving. I spend a lot of my time communicating, be it interacting with toddlers on Toddler Day, teaching kids to do paper animal crafts on Critter day, or teaching guests about Anatomy in the rotunda - and it's a lot of learning how to communicate effectively. Seeing the confusion on their faces and thinking, ok let me try that again. It's also interesting as a common museum-goer to see some of the back end of the work that goes into setting up an exhibit, drawing people in, and how to design a great event for so many people (secret -money does matter because it means more time and manpower). It's fun to talk to people about science, and it has also been a great way to get outside the academic community and see the diversity of Atlanta - Atlanta United jerseys or recently, a banned book shirt, the disheveled parent, the hijab-wearing high schooler, 30-something parents in athleisure, high school friends etc. hearing a taste of Spanish, Chinese, and even Russian amongst the visitors.</p>

Already, we've run workshops on enzymes in the body at the John Robert Lewis Elementary IEEE Science Night, and acids and bases at Morningside Elementary School's Science night. It's fun teaching kids science, and it's incredible to see how some ask really thought provoking questions...scientists in the making!</p>
