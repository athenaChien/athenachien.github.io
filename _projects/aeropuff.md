description: "Year-long, 6-person team project developing an aerosolized drug delivery system with automated inspiratory detection targeting Respiratory Distress Syndrome (RDS). RDS is the leading cause of death for preterm infants, with an untreated mortality rate close to 100%. Luckily, aerosolized surfactants treatments can greatly reduce mortality rate by depositing deeply into the lungs while remaining non-invasive. However, available aerosol delivery systems suffer from extremely low drug efficiency rates (around 1%). By automatically administering a reliable dose of aerosolized pulmonary surfactant during inhalation, our BDAD device shows promise of efficient and effective surfactant delivery solution for infants with RDS. Sponsored by Zewski Corporation. My focus was in the biosignal processing, detecting inhalation from ECG signals."
