description: "<strong>A new bandage to help apply pressure on wounds without interrupting daily life.</strong><br><br>Seniors over the age of 65 often have thin skin, and those on blood thinners currently must interrupt their daily lives upon simple injuries such as a paper cut, forced to apply pressure for up to 30 minutes to allow the blood to clot or otherwise apply an adhesive bandage with risks of skin tearing or other lasting damage. The goal of the Bandeasy is to provide a painless, simple bandage for elderly people on blood thinners that enables them to continue with their daily life."
