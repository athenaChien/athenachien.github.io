description: <strong>A magnetic button to retrofit your favorite button-ups for easier dressing.</strong><br><br> One of the everyday struggles of people with arthritis, parkinsons, and cerebral palsy is doing tasks that require fine motor control, such as buttoning a shirt. The MagnetSnap is an attachable magnetic button set that helps anyone with limited upper body mobility to adapt any shirt with buttons. Once attached to the shirt, a simple shrug is all that is needed to close the shirtâ€™s front. With this low-cost assistive device, people will no longer feel limited in their style choices and can buy shirts at any store for any occasion.<br><br>Winning team of the Rice Biomedical Engineering Society Design-a-thon for People with Disabilities<br><br>Here I learned from experts in engineering design and disability representation Dr. Yvette Pearson, Dr. Marcia O'Malley, and Dr. Lex Frieden, where I learned how meeting ADA requirements and user needs should not be a checklist; it must be a constant conversation with the user about the tradeoffs and optimal design for usability and accessibility (otherwise risking products that are not adopted, or worse, cause damage in unanticipated ways).<br><br><a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/nothing-about-us-without-us-mantra-for-a-movement_b_59aea450e4b0c50640cd61cf">More on representation of the disability community.</a>
