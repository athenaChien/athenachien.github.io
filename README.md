 Notes to self on how to modify pages/files:
* _leadership and _projects have a document for each blurb/project
* index.html is the home page
* _data has publications, others are not in use.
* images are in assets/img

* if you want to tweak the ordering later on, if you go into an md file like aeropuff.md you’ll see “bucket: 00” and that’s what you change with the columns we talked about (0-20, 21-40, 41-60)
* to dos: make sure linkedin linked, add updated resume
