      My leadership experiences have given me the skills to work with people of different personalities, work styles,
      backgrounds, and strengths to create a successful team. Volunteering, in high school, continuing at Rice/Houston,
      and now in Atlanta has continued to expand my perspective as I have listened to people from all walks of life.
      I believe that growing this understanding is critical to learning how to best support underrepresented groups in our
      society and improve education in the United States. These leadership experiences enable me to mentor and support
      other women and underrepresented minorities in STEM.
