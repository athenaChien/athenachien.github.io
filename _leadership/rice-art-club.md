description: "I worked to increase the awareness of the art-stem synergy holistically as a bioengineer leading the club. I also created several new events that strengthened connections internally, within the club, and externally, with the Houston community. Internally, I organized semester-long group paintings in the fall and spring. Art club members enjoyed taking a break from schoolwork to spend time doing art and meeting other students with art interests. For one of the pieces, students researched and discussed the impact Rice’s new startup hub has on the surrounding community: Houston’s historically Black and low-income Third Ward. Externally, I developed a collaboration with a local art and community organization, Project Row Houses. First, students were given a tour of the space and learned about the experiences of families in Third Ward by visiting the art exhibits. Then, they supported the organization by volunteering at an exhibition opening."
