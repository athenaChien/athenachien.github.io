description: "BBUGS is is the largest, most diverse, graduate student group on the Georgia Tech campus and serves as the core student group for the bioengineering and bioscience community. It is comprised of trainees from across eight Georgia Tech departments and multiple colleges. This coming year, I am excited to lead the BBUGS team in its continued success in building connections and community among talented trainees and researchers in the Petit Institute for Bioengineering and Bioscience. Some of our events this year include the annual whitewater rafting and camping trip, the BBUGS carnival to inform students about our committees and events, weekly gardening maintenance at community gardens on campus, alumni career talks, and outreach events at local elementary and high schools."
