description: "Living next to Chicago’s South Side, I learned about historical racial and economic disparities with the migration to the suburbs, and know education is a major component in upward mobility. In college, I have become an advocate for the Houston Coalition for Equitable Development without Displacement (HCEDD) in Houston. I have supported the HCEDD and the Houston Community Benefits Agreement since its formation my junior year, to ensure that the residents of Third Ward, Houston’s historically low-income Black neighborhood, have a say in the development of Rice’s innovation district in their community. As a Rice student, I have supported this by increasing awareness on campus via tabling and attending HCEDD meetings to best understand the wishes of the current Third Ward members. I am committed to improving access and opportunity for all, and have done so by volunteering to assist at these community gatherings and also engaging in the conversations with professors and the Provost on Rice’s stance on supporting the community."
