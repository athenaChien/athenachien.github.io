role: "Education & Outreach Committee Chair 2023, Member 2022"
description: "I joined the Bioengineering and biosciences united graduate student association looking for a way to continue service, improve my communication skills, and get out into the surrounding Atlanta community. Already, we've run workshops on enzymes in the body at the John Robert Lewis Elementary IEEE Science Night, and acids and bases at Morningside Elementary School's Science night. It's fun teaching kids science, and it's incredible to see how some ask really thought provoking questions...scientists in the making!"
