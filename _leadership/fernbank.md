description: "Sometimes community service is standing out of the way and waiting until you're needed. Giving, and not expecting anything in return. But I've found that volunteering at Fernbank, I am gaining a lot, maybe even more than I am giving. I spend a lot of my time communicating, be it interacting with toddlers on Toddler Day, teaching kids to do paper animal crafts on Critter day, or teaching guests about Anatomy in the rotunda - and it's a lot of learning how to communicate effectively. Seeing the confusion on their faces and thinking, ok let me try that again. It's also interesting as a common museum-goer to see some of the back end of the work that goes into setting up an exhibit, drawing people in, and how to design a great event for so many people (secret -money does matter because it means more time and manpower). It's fun to talk to people about science, and it has also been a great way to get outside the academic community and see the diversity of Atlanta - Atlanta United jerseys or recently, a banned book shirt, the disheveled parent, the hijab-wearing high schooler, 30-something parents in athleisure, high school friends etc. hearing a taste of Spanish, Chinese, and even Russian amongst the visitors."
