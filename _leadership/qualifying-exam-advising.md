role: "Student Panelist, Practice Committee Member 2024"
description: Second year biomedical engineering PhD students at Georgia Tech/Emory go through the stressful endeavor of a written qualifying proposal (a slightly abridged version of the typical NIH format), and an oral qualifying exam (90 minutes with a panel of 3 faculty members) to ensure they are prepared for their proposed research. I served as a student panelist to answer questions, and served as a mock" committee member in practice qualifying exams.
