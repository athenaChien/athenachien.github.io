  description: "Includes my work collecting biological results on retinal pigment epithelia at the Bharti lab in the OGVFB division of the National Eye Institute on using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) in conjunction with intracellular voltage recording to independently determine permeability changes in apical, basolateral, and paracellular pathways. Also contributed to manuscript writing."
